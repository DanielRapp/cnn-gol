      <h1>Learning Game of Life with a Convolutional Neural Network</h1>
      <p>
        In Greg Egan's wonderful short story "<i><a href="http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic999265.files/Egan.pdf">Learning to Be Me</a></i>",
        a neural implant, called a "jewel", is inserted into the brain at birth. The jewel monitors activity in order to learn how to mimic the behavior of the brain. From the introduction
      </p>
      <div class="quote">
        <p>
          I was six years old when my parents told me that there was a small, dark jewel inside my skull, learning to be me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Microscopic spiders had woven a fine golden web through my brain, so that the jewel's teacher could listen to the whisper of my thoughts. The jewel itself eavesdropped on my senses, and read the chemical messages carried in my bloodstream; it saw, heard, smelt, tasted and felt the world exactly as I did, while the teacher monitored its thoughts and compared them with my own. Whenever the jewel's thoughts were wrong, the teacher - faster than thought - rebuilt the jewel slightly, altering it this way and that, seeking out the changes that would make its thoughts correct.
        </p>
        <p>
        Why? So that when I could no longer be me, the jewel could do it for me.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        In this article I'd like to discuss
        a way of building this kind of <i>jewel</i>,
        as a convolutional neural network,
        which, after having <i>seen</i> a bunch of iterations of game of life,
        can <i>learn</i> its underlying behaviour.
      </p>

      <h2>Game of life as convolution</h2>
      <p>
        I'll assume you already know
        what game of life is. You have a grid
        of cells, black cells are considered
        <i>dead</i>, white
        cells are considered <i>alive</i>, and there are
        a few rules for updating the grid which are
        inspired by biological processes.
        For instance, <i>if a dead cell has exactly
        three live cells in its $3\times 3$ neighbourhood
        then it's born</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <canvas id="gol-demo" width="650" height="200"></canvas>
      </p>
      <p>
        A <i>convolutional filter</i> is an operation, together
        with a <i>kernel</i> (a small, e.g. $3\times 3$,
        matrix of weights), which transforms an image
        (let's restrict ourselves to grayscale, but
        it could also be extended to color)
        by mapping the intensity of each pixel in the image
        to a weighted sum of the intensities of its neighbours,
        where the weights are determined by the kernel.

        So for instance, the kernel
        $$ B= \begin{bmatrix}
          \frac{1}{9} & \frac{1}{9} & \frac{1}{9} \\
          \frac{1}{9}  & \frac{1}{9} & \frac{1}{9} \\
          \frac{1}{9} & \frac{1}{9} & \frac{1}{9}
        \end{bmatrix}$$
        results in a <i>smudgning</i>, or <i>blurring</i>, of the image
        (since you're taking each pixel
        and blending it with its closest neighbours).
      </p>
      <p class="kernel-demo">
        <canvas id="kernel-pre"></canvas><span class="symbol">$\xrightarrow{\text{B}}$</span><canvas id="kernel-post"></canvas>
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a direct connection between an updating rule
        in game of life, and a convolutional filter.
        I won't dwell on the precise expression[1],
        instead we'll just use this fact as <i>inspiration</i>
        for the architecture of the neural network that follows,
        and trust (hope) that the network will be able to find it for us.
      <p>
      [1] You can read more about this <a href="http://danielrapp.github.io/morph/">here</a>. Think of <i>dialation</i> as just a thresholded convolution.
      </p>
      <h2>Building the jewel</h2>
      <p>
        Thinking of game of life as a biological
        process, how could we now go about building its jewel?
        How could we build a neural network which, given
        a series of game of life frames, can learn
        its behaviour?
      </p>
      <p>
        The architecture is simple.
        The input is a grid with black and white pixels,
        and the output should be the next iteration
        according to the rules of game of life.
      </p>
      <p class="img">
        <img src="img/architecture.svg" width="500" />
      </p>
      <p>
        I chose a two-layered approach.
        The first layer is a convolutional layer, hooking each
        $3\times 3$ neighbourhood to a set of filters
        (arbitrarily fixed to 20) followed by a rectified linear unit[2].
        The idea being that this layer should <i>learn
        the rules</i> for game of life. And it should encode
        those rules in the weights of the filters.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second layer should learn the appropriate
        combination of these rules, and so it
        consists
        of just a (weighted) linear combination
        of all the filters, which is then
        mapped to the output. The whole thing is implemented
        in <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs">convnetjs</a>
        with essentially just the following code
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="code">
      <pre><code class="javascript">
  var layer_defs = [], imgWidth = 9, imgHeight = 9;
  layer_defs.push({ type: 'input', out_sx: imgWidth, out_sy: imgHeight, out_depth: 1 });
  layer_defs.push({ type: 'conv', sx: 3, filters: 20, activation: 'relu', stride: 1, pad: 1 });
  layer_defs.push({ type: 'regression', num_neurons: imgWidth*imgHeight });
      </code></pre>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Let's see it in action!
      </p>
      <p>
        <canvas id="training" width="200" height="200"></canvas>
        <img src="img/transition.svg" id="transition" width="200" />
        <canvas id="training-res" width="200" height="200"></canvas>
      </p>
      <p>
        On the left are a bunch of training examples
        fed into the network, and on the right is the
        output of the network.
        After each new training point, just like in
        Egan's story, the internal
        representation (shown below) is modified slightly to get
        closer and closer to the correct behaviour.
        Here are the filters that make up its internals:
      </p>
      <p>
        <div id="filters-div" class="filters"></div>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you wait for some time you'll see that
        the difference between the desired output (the next game of life iteration)
        and the network output slowly decrease
        as we pump in more and more data

      <p>
        [2] There are already plenty of excellent
        texts explaining the concepts and lingo
        for these kinds of networks, so I won't
        add to the noise (I recommend consulting
        <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html">Nielsen</a>,
        <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~bengioy/dlbook/">Bengio</a> or <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/neuralnets">Hinton</a>).
      </p>


      <h2>Turning on the jewel</h2>
      <p>
        Let the network simmer the stove for a few minutes, and eventually you'll
        get a network with filters tuned to something like this (pre-trained with a couple
        million training examples):
      </p>
      <p>
        <div id="filters-pretrained-div" class="filters"></div>
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's plug in some well known patterns to see how well it fares.
        <br/>Two interesting creatures of period two are <canvas id="p11" class="p"></canvas>$\to$<canvas id="p12" class="p"></canvas>$\to$<canvas id="p13" class="p"></canvas>and<br/><canvas id="p21" class="p"></canvas>$\to$<canvas id="p22" class="p"></canvas>$\to$<canvas id="p23" class="p"></canvas>.
        And indeed, if we plug in one of these into the network/jewel (and threshold), we get the correct behaviour.
        First the "blinker":
      </p>
      <p class="net-period">
        <canvas id="blinker"></canvas><span class="symbol"><img src="img/arrow2.svg" width="50" /></span><canvas id="blinker-res"></canvas><span class="symbol">$\xrightarrow{\text{threshold}}$</span><canvas id="blinker-threshold-1"></canvas><span class="symbol"><img src="img/arrow2.svg" width="50" /></span><canvas id="blinker-thres-res"></canvas><span class="symbol">$\xrightarrow{\text{threshold}}$</span><canvas id="blinker-thres-res-thres"></canvas>
      </p>
      <p>
        And the "toad":
      </p>
      <p>
      <p class="net-period">
        <canvas id="toad"></canvas><span class="symbol"><img src="img/arrow2.svg" width="50" /></span><canvas id="toad-res"></canvas><span class="symbol">$\xrightarrow{\text{threshold}}$</span><canvas id="toad-threshold-1"></canvas><span class="symbol"><img src="img/arrow2.svg" width="50" /></span><canvas id="toad-thres-res"></canvas><span class="symbol">$\xrightarrow{\text{threshold}}$</span><canvas id="toad-thres-res-thres"></canvas>
      </p>
      <p>
        You rarely get perfect accuracy in machine learning, and indeed, even
        here there are cases where it fails. The classic "glider",<br/><canvas id="g1" class="p"></canvas>$\to$<canvas id="g2" class="p"></canvas>$\to$<canvas id="g3" class="p"></canvas>$\to$<canvas id="g4" class="p"></canvas>$\to$<canvas id="g5" class="p"></canvas>, works well for the first two iterations
      </p>
      <p class="net-period">
        <canvas id="glider"></canvas><span class="symbol"><img src="img/arrow2.svg" width="50" /></span><canvas id="glider-res"></canvas><span class="symbol">$\xrightarrow{\text{threshold}}$</span><canvas id="glider-threshold-1"></canvas><span class="symbol"><img src="img/arrow2.svg" width="50" /></span><canvas id="glider-thres-res"></canvas><span class="symbol">$\xrightarrow{\text{threshold}}$</span><canvas id="glider-thres-res-thres"></canvas>
      </p>
      <p>
        But unfortunately it diverges by one pixel in the iteration that follow
      </p>
      <p class="net-period">
        <canvas id="glider-2"></canvas><span class="symbol"><img src="img/arrow2.svg" width="50" /></span><canvas id="glider-2-res"></canvas><span class="symbol">$\xrightarrow{\text{threshold}}$</span><canvas id="glider-2-threshold-1"></canvas><span class="symbol"><img src="img/arrow2.svg" width="50" /></span><canvas id="glider-2-thres-res"></canvas><span class="symbol">$\xrightarrow{\text{threshold}}$</span><canvas id="glider-2-thres-res-thres"></canvas>
      </p>

        I leave you with two animations. One is game of life, the other is the jewel. Can you tell which one is which? (You'll have to check out <a href="https://github.com/DanielRapp/cnn-gol">the code</a> to get the answer.)
